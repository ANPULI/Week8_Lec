# Week8 Lec
Introduction to Computer Science, NYU Shanghai, Segment 3 (Data Science) Week 1

For exercises, in sequence:
- dice
- motecalo
- coin
- random walk

The codes run out of box. The students are required to modify the code such that it runs with their logics without using the corresponding helper file.

Example: dice_student.py imports dice_helper.py and uses a function there. The goal is to be able to run dice_student.py standalone. 
You should *not* read the helper file unless you are desparate.

Good luck and have fun,
